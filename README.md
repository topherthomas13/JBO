Initial attempt at learning .net core

My wife has an art academy business in which she and a group of instructors teach verious types of art classes. For example, 
a canvas painting class.  The main purpose of this project is to create a web site in which she can manage her instructors, 
manage her projects, and manage a class scheduler.

MVP is currently a site that allows for basic CRUD operations for a list of instructors and projects.

The project uses Angular 4.3.6, .NET Core 2.0 API, and .NET Standard Library components.
